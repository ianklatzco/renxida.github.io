As someone who has experienced the chaos of life spiraling out of control due to decision paralysis, I know firsthand how important it is to have a consistent routine. But let's be honest: establishing and maintaining a routine can be a Sisyphean task, especially for those of us with ADHD or other executive-function challenges. That's why I created a webapp powered by GPT-4 that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to make planning a routine as smooth and frictionless as possible.

In the spirit of the Huberman Lab and other research-driven resources, I crafted a prompt for GPT-4 that encourages it to base its recommendations on "science-based tools" and "research-supported principles." This ensures that your generated routine is not only tailored to your specific needs but also grounded in evidence-based strategies.

The beauty of this webapp lies in its simplicity. No need to create an account or spend hours learning a new app. Instead, you simply log into your Google Calendar, paste a prompt into GPT-4 to generate a JSON representation of your routine, and then import it into the webapp to add it to your calendar. Voila! Your personalized routine is ready to guide you through your day.

What sets this webapp apart from other productivity tools is the low learning curve and intuitive interface. By leveraging the vast knowledge of GPT-4, the app provides sane defaults and allows for easy adjustments through chat. The webapp acts as a gentle guide, helping you navigate your day with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.

Customization is a breeze. Whether you need to make a small tweak or a major overhaul, simply type your request into the chat. And if you want to save your customizations for the long term, just edit the prompt! The app is designed to be as accessible and user-friendly as possible, supporting both English and Chinese languages.

While the webapp is still in its alpha phase, I have personally used it to plan my routine for a week straight. The only time I pulled an all-nighter was when I was writing this blog post out of sheer excitement for how well the project was working. I'm currently working on creating a production-quality UX and pushing the app to the cloud so that everyone can use it for free.

If you're interested in trying out the webapp and seeing firsthand how it can revolutionize your routine, please contact me by email to get started. Together, we can help tame the chaos and bring order to even the most hectic of lives.
