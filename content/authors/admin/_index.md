I am Xida Ren, pursuing a ML hardware security & performance PhD at UVA Computer Architecture Lab while interning at Intel.

My current research interests include hardware security, profiling, and software-hardware co-design. 

I'm interested in learning about ML hardware supply chain security, and regulation surrounding the semiconductor supply chain, especially ML-related hardware.
